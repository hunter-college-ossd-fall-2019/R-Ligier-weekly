### Sourcetrail 

#### [Tom Callaway's Blog Post](https://spot.livejournal.com/327801.html) and [The Importance of Open Source for Companies](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2015/1/top-advantages-open-source-offers-over-proprietary-solutions)

While both articles discuss different parts of the advantages within open source software, their main takeaways are the same - *Open source software is better for enterprise companies to use because they have full control of the software along with other key benefits that proprietary software does not offer.* I agree with this statement very much and while reading both of those articles, it made me think back to times in the past where I've been frustrated with the limitations of personalization that came with the propriatary software that I use at work. 

I feel that proprietary software companies are great at marketing themselves. Pay x amount and you'll have your own representetitive for direct questions and so forth. Truth be told it sure doesn't work that easily. I've seen this with Salesforce especially. A company will buy a set of Salesforce licenses and receive a basic CRM with a few customizable options and fields. However, additional and more complex features requires a salesforce consultant or hiring a person who knows the software to be able to do that. 


#### Would you want to work in a company that only produced open source software? Why or why not? What would your dream job be? How would you like to see the business of software production in ten years?

- I wouldn't mind if the company I worked for only produced open source software - as long as it aligned with my morals and values of course. However, if the company didn't, it would be a deal breaker for me. 

- I currently do not have a dream job however, I do have many ideas that I'd love to see happen/come to life someday. In addition, I am confident to say that as an engineer, I have a set of values that I follow and will only build technology for a company who aligns with my values.

- I hope that in the next ten years, open source software will become increasingly popular over proprietary software and that more companies will take part in contributing. 


#### Project Progress/Update

This week, I did some more exploring into open source projects on GitHub and I came across this project called [Sourcetrail]( https://www.sourcetrail.com/). Here is their description of what they do: `Software developers spend most of their time figuring out existing source code, but common code editing tools offer little help for this task. Debuggers only allow detailed inspection of one narrow code path. 'Find all references' helps you in navigating between files, but doesn't provide the context to see the big picture of all relevant dependencies. Sourcetrail provides both overview and details by combining an interactive dependency graph, a concise code view and efficient code search, all built into an easy-to-use cross-platform developer tool. It supports you in exploring legacy code, understanding the implementation and refactoring the software architecture, making it a fun experience for the whole family!`

This project is pretty active and I figured I could work on their [documentation](https://www.sourcetrail.com/documentation/) page. However, upon searching their [repo](https://github.com/CoatiSoftware/Sourcetrail/tree/a177c6daf506f1b949e2d55d8cedce4e12eb9717) for the files, I was unsuccessful on finding where they live. I then came to the conclusion that the website does not live on GitHub. Since I really wanted to contribute to the projects documentation, I decided to reach out to the two maintainers via email (their emails were listed in the repos authors file). Here is the text of our email chain:

``` 
Hi Eberhard and Malte,

My name is Rivka and I came across the Sourcetrail project on GitHub and love the idea! I'd like to make a contribution via documentation and was unsuccessful on finding where this page (or text) lives in the repo (my assumption is bec the website itself does not live on GitHub). 

Is there a way to still contribute to the documentation of the project?

I am really interested in technical writing and love to write hence why I'd love to work on the documentation piece of this project.

Please let me know.

Thank you!
...
```
I then received a response 1 hour later: 
```
Hi Rivka,

thank you for reaching out to us. We know that having a good documentation is crucial, so it sounds really great for us that you are offering your help!
We have already been planning to move the documentation to the open-source Sourcetrail repo in the near future, but let me see if I can speed this up.
....
```
And the next morning:
```
Hey Rivka,
we've added the documentation to our GitHub repository: https://github.com/CoatiSoftware/Sourcetrail/tree/master/docs/documentation

Happy contributing :)
...
```

Needless to say, I am pretty happy I made the decision to reach out to them! I was close to just giving up and continuing my search for a project. Now that those files exist on their repo, I'll be working on "cleaning" up the documentation and also re-structing the layout. I'm pretty excited for this. I am also of course planning to try out the software myself to get a feel of what the installation and usability is like. I'll be using the documentation to do this that way I can get an idea if the instructions and information align with my experience. This will help a lot with the clean up.

**Update 11/29/2019** <br>
I just submitted a [PR](https://github.com/CoatiSoftware/Sourcetrail/pull/816) for some changes I made to the first two sections of Soucetrails documentation and my god that was fun!! I am so happy that I found this project and can work on their documentation. Hopefully they'll be happy with the changes I made and accept my PR.
