#### [Tom Callaway's Blog Post](https://spot.livejournal.com/327801.html) and [The Importance of Open Source for Companies](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2015/1/top-advantages-open-source-offers-over-proprietary-solutions)

While both articles discuss different parts of the advantages within open source software, their main takeaways are the same. *Open source software is better for enterprise companies to use because they have full control of the software along with other key benefits that proprietary software does not offer.* I agree with this statement very much and while I read both of those articles, I thought back to times in the past where I've been frustrated with the limitations of personalization that came with the propriatary software that I use at work. 

I feel that proprietary software companies are great at marketing themselves. Pay x amount and you'll have your own representetitive for direct questions and so forth. Truth be told it sure doesnn't work that easily. I've seen this with Salesforce especially. A company will buy a set of Salesforce licenses and receive a basic CRM with a few customizable options and fields. However, additional and more complex features requires a salesforce consultant or hiring a person who knows the software to be able to do that. 


#### Would you want to work in a company that only produced open source software? Why or why not? What would your dream job be? How would you like to see the business of software production in ten years?

I would like to work for a company whose software is a mix of open source and proprietary but open source being the majority.
