### Project Progress and [The Cathedral and the Bazaar](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html)

#### [Project](https://github.com/firstcontributions/firstcontributions.github.io) Progress

The project I chose to work on is the website [](firstcontributions.github.io). They display open source projects that are beginner friendly for first time contributors. I picked this project because I found an area in their documentation that I felt could be improved and liked the idea of the project. As I mentioned in last week blog post, I opened an issue regarding their documentation that I wanted to better which was accepted and then assigned to me. Progress has been a bit slow on the [firstcontibutions.github.io](https://github.com/firstcontributions/firstcontributions.github.io) project and I am thinking of starting to look for a new project to contribute to because of this. I am working on this [issue](https://github.com/firstcontributions/firstcontributions.github.io/issues/78) that I opened and upon working on it in order to resolve it, I came across some scenarios which may affect on how I resolve the issue. Before just making a pull request or simply giving up (?), I thought it'd be a good idea to bring this up to the maintainers and get their thoughts. However, I have yet to hear back from them after 6 days! If I don't hear back by next week I'll be looking for a different project to contribute to.

#### Thoughts on the [Cathedral and the Bazaar](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html)

I really enjoyed reading the Cathedral and the Bazaar. The author Eric Raymond, did a great job 
1. Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch.
2. Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).
3. "Plan to throw one away; you will, anyhow." (Fred Brooks, The Mythical Man-Month, Chapter 11)
4. If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.
5. When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor.
6. Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.
7. Release early. Release often. And listen to your customers.

#### Weekly Summary

This week in class we did an activity simulating working with a team of contributors to an upstream project. It causes merge conflicts and shows you how to use git fetch, git merge, and git rebase to synchronize your work. We have yet to finish yet but will be completing it by 10/30.

In addition, I've also made a few OpenStreetMap contributions and submitted a pull request for tobyau blog's 6 where I did some re-phrasing and grammar fixes.
