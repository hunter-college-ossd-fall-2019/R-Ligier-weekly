### Project Progress and [The Cathedral and the Bazaar](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html)

#### [Project](https://github.com/firstcontributions/firstcontributions.github.io) Progress

Progress has been a bit slow on the [firstcontibutions.github.io](https://github.com/firstcontributions/firstcontributions.github.io) project and I am thinking of starting to look for a new project to contribute to because of this. I am working on this [issue](https://github.com/firstcontributions/firstcontributions.github.io/issues/78) that I opened and upon working on it in order to resolve it, I came across some scenarios which may affect on how I resolve the issue. Before just making a pull request, I thought it'd be a good idea to bring this up to the maintainers and get their thoughts. However, I have yet to hear back from them after 6 days! If I don't hear back by next week I'll be looking for a different project to contribute to.

#### Thoughts on the Cathedral and the Bazaar

1. Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch.
2. Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).
3. "Plan to throw one away; you will, anyhow." (Fred Brooks, The Mythical Man-Month, Chapter 11)
4. If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.
5. When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor.
6. Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.
7. Release early. Release often. And listen to your customers.
