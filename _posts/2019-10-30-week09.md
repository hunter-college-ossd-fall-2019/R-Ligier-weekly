### Project Progress and [The Cathedral and the Bazaar](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html)

#### [Project](https://github.com/firstcontributions/firstcontributions.github.io) Progress

The project I chose to work on is the website [](firstcontributions.github.io). They display open source projects that are beginner friendly for first time contributors. I picked this project because I found an area in their documentation that I felt could be improved and liked the idea of the project. As I mentioned in last week blog post, I opened an issue regarding their documentation that I wanted to better which was accepted and then assigned to me. Progress has been a bit slow on the [firstcontributions.github.io](https://github.com/firstcontributions/firstcontributions.github.io) project and I am thinking of starting to look for a new project to contribute to because of this. I am working on this [issue](https://github.com/firstcontributions/firstcontributions.github.io/issues/78) that I opened and upon working on it in order to resolve it, I came across some scenarios which may affect on how I resolve the issue. Before just making a pull request or simply giving up (?), I thought it'd be a good idea to bring this up to the maintainers and get their thoughts. However, I have yet to hear back from them after 6 days! If I don't hear back by next week I'll be looking for a different project to contribute to.

#### Thoughts on the [Cathedral and the Bazaar](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html)

I really enjoyed reading the Cathedral and the Bazaar. The author Eric Raymond, did a great job of comparing open source development to a cathedral and bazaar. In short, a he stresses that a cathedral is best built with a large network of passionate people. Eric then relates this to the bulding and his involvement with Linux. 

My three favorite concepts Eric raises are the following: 

1. Release early. Release often. And listen to your customers.
This concept comes from Eric explaining Linus's style of development. He goes on to say how the Linux community resembled a babbling bazaar with diering agendas and approches. I was impressed with this concept because it reminded me of the agile method and I am wondering if this was part of Linus's style of development as well. The Agile Method is a particular approach to project management that is utilized in software development. The method uses incremental, iterative work sequences in order to have some certainty what is being built is liked by the customer/user and is effective. This is to avoid building projects in completion that in turn may end up failing. Components of the project are broken down into small parts where different people on a team work on different parts. 

2. To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you.
One of the stories Eric tells his readers is his own personal experience with solving an issue he believed to be a problem - "What I needed was a program that would reach out over my intermittent dialup connection and pull across my mail to be delivered locally". 

Quote I like:
Human beings generally take pleasure in a task when it falls in a sort of optimal-challenge zone; not so easy as to be boring, not too hard to achieve. A happy programmer is one who is neither under-utilized nor weighed down with ill-formulated goals and stressful process friction. Enjoyment predicts e?ciency

#### Weekly Summary

This week in class we did an activity simulating working with a team of contributors to an upstream project. It causes merge conflicts and shows you how to use git fetch, git merge, and git rebase to synchronize your work. We have yet to finish but will be completing it by 10/30.

In addition, I've also made a few OpenStreetMap contributions and submitted a pull request for tobyau blog's 6 where I did some re-phrasing and grammar fixes.
