### Project Progress and [The Cathedral and the Bazaar](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html)

#### [Project](https://github.com/firstcontributions/firstcontributions.github.io) Progress

Progress has been a bit slow on the [firstcontibutions.github.io](https://github.com/firstcontributions/firstcontributions.github.io) project and I am thinking of starting to look for a new project to contribute to because of this. I am working on this [issue](https://github.com/firstcontributions/firstcontributions.github.io/issues/78) that I opened and upon working on it in order to resolve it, I came across some scenarios which may effect on how I resolve the issue. Before just making a pull request, I thought it'd be a good idea to bring this up to the maintainers and get their thoughts. However, I have yet to hear back from them after 6 days! If I don't hear back by next week I'll be looking for a different project to contribute to.
