#### Here's what I've learned so far about git and GitHub

In the beginning of the git/GitHub introduction given in class, I felt like I had most things packed down in terms of commands, what they do, and also figuring out how to get out of certain git situations. The website https://ohshitgit.com/ has come to be very handy in the past when getting into messy git issues. Nevertheless, I was taken aback when forking and setting up an upstream were introduced. I had never done neither and weirdly had a difficult time grasping the concept. 

Last weeks class on Thursday really helped connect the concept for me. I think it had to do with a combination of doing it in a group and also following a step by step guide which really made things easier and clearer. It was also helpful knowing that the professor was there in case I had immediate questions. During the class activity and with things finally clicking, I realized that the way I went about forking and setting up an upstream to contribute to a classmates blog was done incorrectly - that won't be happening again now. 

It sure is a great feeling when things make sense :)


#### Some random thoughts ...

A few days ago, I checked out my neighborhood on OpenMaps to see if stores were marked on it and ... it's pretty much empty. None of the stores that exist other than a bagel shop are marked on the map. While that kind of sucks, i'm also excited because i'm planning on adding most of what I can to it. I'm also a bit curious as to who added the bagel shop (LOL).
