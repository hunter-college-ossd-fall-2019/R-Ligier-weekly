### Reflection

When I first started this course, I was set out to contribute to an open source project via documentation. I mentioned in my first blog post that the goal was to begin building some kind of portfolio for technical writing. Luckily, I can say that this stuck!

My first contrbution was to this project: and my second was to this project:. In both projects, I made documentational edits but second project being my biggest contribution. In addition, both projects also aligned with one of my values which I mentioned in my second blog post was important for finding the projects that would suit me and interest me.
