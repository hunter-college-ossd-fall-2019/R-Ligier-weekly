### Week 8 

This week our professor had Bill Reyner from FactSet Research Systems come in as a guest speaker to  discuss what the firm does, how they use open source, why they want to expand their engagement with open source, and lastly, some of the challenges with that engagement in a large corporate environment. Unfortunately, I had missed this talk since I was summoned for jury duty.
