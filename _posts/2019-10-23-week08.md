### Jury Duty and Contributing 

This week our professor had Bill Reyner from FactSet Research Systems come in as a guest speaker to  discuss what the firm does, how they use open source, why they want to expand their engagement with open source, and lastly, some of the challenges with that engagement in a large corporate environment. Unfortunately, I had missed this talk since I was summoned for jury duty.

Here is how I felt being summoned for Jury Duty:

#### Weekly Summary:

- [OpenStreetMap contribution](https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/75939331#map=19/40.61504/-73.98063) - I added my favorite place to buy avocados in my neighborhood.
- [firstcotributions.github.io issue](https://github.com/firstcontributions/firstcontributions.github.io/issues/78) - Encountered some situations that might affect solving this issue so I've left a comment in the discussion and im now waiting for next steps. I was a bit nervous to do this because I don't want to seem "stupid" but the maintainers seem pretty nice so crossing my fingers that their response is good :see_no_evil:
