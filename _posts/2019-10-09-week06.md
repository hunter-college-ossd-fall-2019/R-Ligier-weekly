#### A talk by Karen Sandler and my thoughts on it

This week in class, Karen Sandler came by and gave a talk on open source software. She introduced herself by starting off with her story and what lead her to become a lawyer in tech. I admired it as her career was stemmed off passion and personal experience. She became a lawyer in tech specifically open source because she believes we should allhave access to source code when the piece of technology is impacting our life. I could relate to her as well since I'm motivated to start an open source project based off personal experience that I feel can help others.
