#### What types of contributions do you think are suitable choices for you to make as your first contributions to an open source project? What types of projects interest you and how do you see your relationship to them?

I feel that the suitable choice for me to contribute to an open source project is through documentation. I LOVE to write and have always been interested in technical documentation but did not have a chance to dive into it. In my experience, I've felt that a lot of documentation out there is not beginner friendly and I want to change that. This will be a great opportunity for me to do so and will also help me build a portfolio around technical documentation. 

The types of projects that would interest me are projects that aim to bring many resources into one place. To explain, you can think about learning materials, normally a person would google a bunch of things and gather information that way. However, someone has done this already, so putting that somewhere nicely and sharing it would be ideal. Pretty much projects that centralize information in efforts to help others become a better version of themselves or even just simply making their lives easier somehow is what I am interested in. 

I could see my relationship with projects in my interests being pretty involved. I would definitely contribute in other ways other than just documentation.
