### Thoughts on ["Makers and Takers" by Dries Buytaert](https://dri.es/balancing-makers-and-takers-to-scale-and-sustain-open-source)

While this article was a bit lengthy, I really enjoyed reading it and could say that I agree on the authors perspective. Eric defines *Makers* as [enter quote] and *Takers* as [enter quote]. He goes on to define these two roles in more depth on how they put open source projects at an advantage or disadvantage. Later on in his article and also my favorite section, he dives into how a growing project changes and makes suggestions on best practices to keep it going.

- Projects need to have some exclusive benefits/rewards, rules, accountability for all involved in the contribution of the project.

#### **Project Progress**
In week 9's blog post, I mentioned the maintainers not responding for about 6 days to my comment in the discussion. Well, the next day they did! This made me pretty happy :sweat_smile:. The maintainer I mainly was having discussions with ended up including the second maintainer because it seems that the comment regarding an error I had, striked up a possible second issue that was irrelevant to solving mine. They spoke among themselves on how to resolve it and I chimed in to then ask if I should go about solving my issue a different way. I am now waiting to hear back on this. Below is a mini timeline of what's been happening:

| Date      | Event          | 
| ------------- |-------------|
| 10/13/2019   | Opened issue regarding CONTRIBUTING.md file lacking instructions|
| 10/ /2019      | Attempted to work on resolving issue and encountered an error   | 
| 11/01/2019 | Maintainers discuss among themselves and realize there is another issue and asks if I can fix it. New issue - add a file name to the .gitignore file     |


Once I submit a pull request, I'll start looking for another project I can contribute to. I'd really like to find a project that is heavy on documentation such as ones who focus on interview prep or guides. I feel like I can contribute way more with this scenario.
