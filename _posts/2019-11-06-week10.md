### Thoughts on ["Makers and Takers" by Dries Buytaert](https://dri.es/balancing-makers-and-takers-to-scale-and-sustain-open-source)

While this article was a bit lengthy, I really enjoyed reading it and could say that I agree on the authors perspective. Eric defines *Makers* as the ones who `"...help make Open Source projects; from investing in code, to helping with marketing, growing the community of contributors, and much more"` and *Takers* as the ones who `"....monetize Open Source projects without contributing back to those projects"`. He goes on to define these two roles in more depth and how *Takers* hurt *Makers*. Later on in his article and also my favorite section, he dives into how a growing project changes and makes suggestions on best practices to keep it going.

Introduces three patterns for sustaining an open source project long-term:
1. **Self-governance:**
2. **Privatization:**
3. **Centralization:**


#### **Project Progress**
In week 9's blog post, I mentioned the maintainers not responding for about 6 days to my comment in the discussion. Well, the next day they did! This made me pretty happy :sweat_smile:. The maintainer I mainly was having discussions with ended up including the second maintainer because it seems that the comment regarding an error I had, striked up a possible second issue that was irrelevant to solving mine. They spoke among themselves on how to resolve it and I chimed in to then ask if I should go about solving my issue a different way. They then followed up with me asking to solve the issue I opened along with the second issue that was discovered. 

The two issues are as follows: 
1. Lack of instructions missing in their CONTRIBUTING.md file.
2. Add package-lock.json file to .gitignore file. 

Here's a mini timeline:

| Date      | Event          | 
| ------------- |-------------|
| 10/13/2019 | Opened issue regarding CONTRIBUTING.md file lacking instructions|
| 10/20/2019 | Attempted to work on resolving issue and encountered an error but sadly failed and brought this up to the maintainers|
| 10/29/2019 | A maintainer responds back to me offering help. I then responded the same day with a screenshot of my error. The maintainer includes the second maintainer to ask a question that may be related to why I encountered that error.|
| 11/01/2019 | Maintainers discuss among themselves and realize there is another issue and asks if I can fix it. New issue - add a file name to the .gitignore file. |
| 11/02/2019 | Submitted pull request :muscle: Hopefully it is accepted! |


Now that i've submitted a pull request, I will spend the rest of the week looking for another project I can contribute to. I'd really like to find a project that is heavy on documentation such as ones who focus on interview prep or guides. I feel like I can contribute way more with this scenario.
