#### Prompt: Why you decided to take a course in open source software.

Prior to this course, I had known and been aware of open source projects/software and the benefits of contributing to them. I've also even used them (LibreOffice). However, when I attempted to search for one, the ones I found, seemed pretty large and I wasn't so sure on HOW I could even contribute. I didn't necessairly want to code. I was more interested in doing technical documenting in order to build somewhat of a protfolio around that. I also felt intimidated because of how many people had cotributed that what could I possibly do. 

Fast forward to this summer, I experienced something personal and thought of an idea on how I could solve this for myself and others. I began working on the project on my own time but thought that it'd be nice to actually build a community around working on this. Needless to say, I wanted to make it open source but didn't know where to begin. I discovered some resources provided by GitHub on how to go about this but had so many questions and no one to really go to for help. 

And sooooo here I am in this course, hoping after the semester is over, I can contribute to an open source project as well as start one.
