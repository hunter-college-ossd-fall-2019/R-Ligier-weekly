#### Hi There!

My name is Rivka and I am an undergraduate Computer Science student at Hunter College. This past summer I interned at Etsy as a Software Engineer and worked on their Conversations team building out an SMS integration. I will be returning there full-time
once I graduate in May 2020.

During my free time, you can find me at the gym, hanging out with friends, and going on adventures.
